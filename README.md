# Parallel Queues with Time Delay

This code was written for my project as part of my Honours Degree in Statistics at the University of Auckland. The project was supervised by Ilze Ziedins and Riccardo Mogre. 

# The functions
The functions used in the simulation are all in the file `simulationfunctions.R`

# Requirements
To run the simulation and create the models, the following R packages must be installed:
- `tidyverse`

# Running the simulations
Examples of how the simulation can be used can be found in `simulationexample1.R`
